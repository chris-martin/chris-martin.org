I am no cooking expert, but Julie endorses the accuracy of this post.

Some helpful facts:

  1. When food browns, it can stick to a porous cooking surface; a coating of oil on the cooking surface prevents this.
  2. Ingredients typically contain oils which, in the normal course of cooking, incidentally end up deposited onto the cookware.
  3. A cooking surface is used at temperatures that kill any bacteria present on it.

Therefore, always keep some oil on the skillet. Fact 1 tells us why this is helpful, fact 2 tells us that it is convenient, and fact 3 assures us it is safe.

I was not, until recently, able to use an iron skillet. The reasons:

  - I have always used "non-stick" cookware made of nonporous material (until it starts showing signs of age), so I have never needed to think about fact 1.
  - Dish soap removes oil very readily (which is desirable for most cleaning tasks). Since I have always used dish soap to deal with fact 2, I have always had fairly sterile cooking surfaces and no need to think about fact 3.

My new habits:

  - Clean the skillet by scraping stuff off, without soap.
  - If the surface doesn't look shiny, melt a little oil on there.

I see a lot of other people who apparently also find iron skillets as mystifying as I did. What's upsetting to me about this phenomenon is that it represents a common feedback loop between technology, ignorance, and consumerism. Non-stick cookware obviates the need to understand any of the facts I've mentioned here. But it does wear down, whereas an iron skillet will *never* become any worse for wear. Not having any iron around, we lose this basic competence and come to depend on disposable alternatives to a tool that ought to be indestructible and timeless.
