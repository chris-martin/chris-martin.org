Let's start by getting the ridiculous extrema out of the way.

  * There can exist immoral actions of free software publication. (Hypothetical example: Within useful and apparently innocuous code, I intentionally craft a concealed flaw which randomly deletes user data. I include standard legal boilerplate stating that the software comes with no warranty and that I assume no liability for damage caused by the software. However, I dishonestly represent the software as working and correct to the best of my knowledge. This is unacceptable behavior.)

  * Publishing free software is not in itself a general commitment to do anything whatsoever that users of the software request.
