The secret to various arts is that they don't really require virtuosity; anything you do by hand will look nicer than anything made by machine, any way you shake the instrument strings is more pleasing than an artificial reproduction of the most skilled player.

That's an exaggeration, but not by a lot. They're all just ways of reminding people that there's life and that somebody cares.

"Great art" is an exception an irrelevant to work in general. Innovation and expressing yourself also don't matter. As with so many other things, one shouldn't suffer under the confused belief that what specialists do defines the nature or purpose of the activity.
