As a computer programmer, the old joke goes, I know 10 kinds of people: Those who can code, and those who can’t. Most who can’t don’t believe that they could, and most who can think that more should. We think they should because we have seen our imagined medium for endless creativity wilt into a platform for passive entertainment far worse than television. Because the internet we hoped would democratize communication, information, and software has centralized these things instead. Because the devices are too many and controlled by the programming of vendors too few. We are not in control, we feel alone, and we need help.

It is said that computer programming is too much of a priesthood, a cabal difficult to break into. It is said that computer programming should be viewed instead as the new baseline for literacy. Just as all children are expected to read and write to meaningfully participate in a society in which so much depends on the written word, so too must the modern child learn to code. When so much depends on computers, those who can’t code will be left behind. Raising educational standards by expanding the scope of literacy sounds inspiring, but when we consider that literacy is in decline, what it inspires is despair.

When we talk about literacy we have to start with scripture. A quick timeline: For a long time, writing exists but the culture is not yet a literate culture because few books exist. In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg builds his gadget. 1522, Martin Luther publishes a German Bible. 1534, the Church of England begins its breakaway from the Pope. 1604, Johannes Kepler says planets’ orbits are elliptical. 1689, John Locke says people have individual rights. Europe proliferates books; they read their Bibles; they stop trusting the Pope; philosophy and science flourish.

Luther’s reformation replaced central authority with local authority, and it replaced religious icons with books. We are now undergoing the Reformation in reverse: Power is recentralizing into collectors of unpredecented wealth whose word is edict, and they require us to touch their icons.

In the pre-literate era, there weren’t many books. In the [post-literate era](https://jmarriott.substack.com/p/the-dawn-of-the-post-literate-society-aa1), books exist but are not read. We can read, but nothing long or substantial. We can communicate via text message. Maybe we can even code enough to do homework in an intro computer science course. But we probably cannot write a treatise that will move the world, and our peers would lack the ability to understand it anyway. Few have computer literacy sufficient to affect the edicts of the software priesthood in any way. So what will spark a Programming Reformation that will bring power over computers to the masses and create an Enlightenment driven by what we build with it?

It won’t be sparked by the programming tools of tech giants. Mark Zuckerberg isn’t Martin Luther; he’s the Pope, and the salvation that his firm offers depends on you not knowing how to obtain it on your own.

It won’t be sparked by programming tools invented by well-meaning enthusiasts who seek to lower barriers to entry by streamlining, simplifying, and hiding away detail. Rather than strictly denying access to scripture, this group insists that you shouldn’t *need* to read it. Simple abstractions and hosted platforms. High-level programming systems built by someone who knows more than you, and will always know more than you because the easy-to-learn system would not have been sufficient to invent itself. Launch your app in a day!–as long as your app fits within the confines of the rails envisioned by your benevolent predecessor. This is Huxleyan rather than Orwellian gatekeeping, but what matters is that still it holds the gate.

This Reformation won’t be sparked by software at all, because unlike the previous one, what holds it back isn’t the want of a gadget. The requirements for storage, organization, and dissemination of thought are already available but languishing in disuse.

Agency requires broad understanding of the whole human project that spans a great body of literature. It thrives bathed in a fullness of context to explore. You aren’t empowering anyone by convincing them not to read. Capability to have and to manifest will does not subsist on the encapsulated products of summarized and refined history. It does not exist without a patience to engage with the greater discourse of complex ideas.

In a hyperstimulating media environment, intellect may not exist at all. Maybe programming isn’t especially difficult to learn. Maybe the reason it appears so is that in this era of computers and the cat videos they provide, complex thought is inhibited so badly that now *all* things are difficult to learn.

Luther had faith in the people to read the text, and, with help, understand it. Maybe that’s what we need to rediscover ourselves as insubordinate to computers: faith and some help.

This piece emerged out of conversations with my wife, [Julie Moronuki](https://argumatronic.com/), a great writer and reader of books who once taught herself Haskell and is currently teaching herself how to make whole grain sourdough.
