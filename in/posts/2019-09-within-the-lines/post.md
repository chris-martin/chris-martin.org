> The day was prismatic. The air, memories of pebbles, music and colors in the sand danced before Fisher's eyes and heart in a pattern which comforted him. He walked and thought within the lines of a big Navajo rug. His days and ideas became a reverberation of successive grey black and white squares, each filled with things he paused to know and then allowed to pass around and through him, changing him, tinting his dreams. Patterns of his own life and those of others shimmered about him, separate for a time.
