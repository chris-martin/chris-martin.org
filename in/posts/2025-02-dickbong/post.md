Aware I am of the futility of forcing language, there’s one word I’ve got to try.

For years I’ve heard Julie use the word “dickbong” without thinking much of it. It has some obvious sense: A dickbong is not a situation you want to be in. It shares an ideophonic quality that makes the meaning of “boondoggle” guessable without its backstory. I’ve slalomed among Atlanta potholes murmuring “10th Street is a *shitfuck*” — Same vibes. I never gave dickbong much thought because we have no shortage of general language for complaining, but recently I have learned its history and richer significance, and now it has no substitute.

Skipping an unknown beginning that would likely enhance this fourth-hand anecdote, I am forced to open cold on an American man relaxing on a beach in Australia, where for reasons lost to time he is temporarily without possessions and clad only in underwear briefs.

He is approached by a vendor of the sort I have seen only in cartoons using the interior of his trenchcoat to conceal and to display illicit wares. Clearly seeing our protagonist with no means of purchase, the peddler nevertheless opens a side of the coat, disclosing an array of novelty drug paraphernalia. And with a jovial cheek I imagine uniquely Australian he proposes:

“Swap your jocks for a dickbong, mate?”

And at last I know the true meaning of a dickbong. It isn’t just another word for something stupid or undesirable. It is a very special kind of clusterfuck. Now that you have the language, you will start to notice them in your life. When we trade something we really *need* — like your only article of clothing — for something we don’t even *want*: That’s a dickbong.
