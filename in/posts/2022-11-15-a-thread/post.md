I just started to write a thread on Twitter, and I deleted it. I'd like not to
write for that website anymore. It's nothing against Twitter specifically. I
want to be more in control of my own writing. It's the same reason I stopped
writing for Stack Overflow.

I got into a very strong Twitter habit because being able to publish a thread
incrementally, as I think of things, helps me get writing out there instead of
just letting things stew under excessive editing. I do a thread throughout the
day, thinking of it in the background, and it doesn't have to take up a
concerted block of time that I would usually dedicate to a blog post. This is
why I've got sixty thousand tweets on main, whereas I've not blogged in a year.

I've been sacrificing more than I'd like for the sake of easily developing the
habit I wanted, and I don't think it has to be this way.
