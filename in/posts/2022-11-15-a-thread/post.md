abstract: Thoughts about where the writing should go
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just started to write a thread on Twitter, and I deleted it. I'd like not to
write for that website anymore. It's nothing against Twitter specifically. I
want to be more in control of my own writing. It's the same reason I stopped
writing for Stack Overflow.

I got into a very strong Twitter habit because being able to publish a thread
incrementally, as I think of things, helps me get writing out there instead of
just letting things stew under excessive editing. I do a thread throughout the
day, thinking of it in the background, and it doesn't have to take up a
concerted block of time that I would usually dedicate to a blog post. This is
why I've got sixty thousand tweets on main, whereas I've not blogged in a year.

I've been sacrificing more than I'd like for the sake of easily developing the
habit I wanted, and I don't think it has to be this way. There shouldn't be any
reason I can't write that way without a website to coerce me into it.

I've requested my Twitter archive, and I've been thinking about gradually
pulling out anything interesting I've written into blog posts, perhaps backdated
in some way. Not everything I recover is necessarily meant to go on the blog,
but that's what I've got for now. What I really want is to get it all into a
format I have some control over. What happens next, I have ideas.
