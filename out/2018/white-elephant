I got a lot of mixed feedback on that writing. Most importantly to me, <a href="https://argumatronic.com/">Julie</a> absolutely hated it. It took me far too long to come around to seeing why people described it as &quot;mocking&quot; and &quot;bullying,&quot; but I think I can finally explain my mistake now.</p><p>Two things I did in that Stack Overflow answer:</p><ol><li><p>I wrote an answer that I knew the asker would not understand or find immediately useful.</p></li><li><p>I included some jokes.</p></li></ol><p>Neither of these is a necessarily a problem by itself, but the two things do not combine.</p><p>Positive humor incorporates the audience. Even in a non-interactive medium, it should feel like you and I are in on the joke together. You cannot do that with technical writing that is over someone&#39;s head. Jokes are appropriate when the reader has a full understanding because it feels like laughing along. Jokes are inappropriate when the reader is confused because it feels like being laughed at.</p><p>Humor can be pleasant to people who are already comfortable. Humor is likely unpleasant to people to are already uncomfortable.</p><p>Not only did I completely fail to bring the asker in on the jokes, but the context then amplified the result. That answer got a pile of upvotes, which produces the experience of a room in which everyone is laughing but you.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t really matter if the joke wasn&#39;t mean-spirited, it doesn&#39;t really matter if the joke wasn&#39;t directed at you. The intent is irrelevant. Nobody wants to feel like the only person in the room not laughing.</p></div></div></div></main><div class="post-footer container"><p>I write about Haskell and related topics; you can find my works online on <a href="http://typeclasses.com">Type Classes</a> and in print from <a href="http://joyofhaskell.com"><span style="text-decoration: italic;">The Joy of Haskell</span></a>.</p></div></body></html>
