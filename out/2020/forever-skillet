Fact 1 tells us why this is helpful, fact 2 tells us that it is convenient, and fact 3 assures us it is safe.</p><p>I was not, until recently, able to use an iron skillet. The reasons:</p><ul><li>I have always used &quot;non-stick&quot; cookware made of nonporous material (until it starts showing signs of age), so I have never needed to think about fact 1.</li><li>Dish soap removes oil very readily (which is desirable for most cleaning tasks). Since I have always used dish soap to deal with fact 2, I have always had fairly sterile cooking surfaces and no need to think about fact 3.</li></ul><p>My new habits:</p><ul><li>Clean the skillet by scraping stuff off, without soap.</li><li>If the surface doesn&#39;t look shiny, melt a little oil on there.</li></ul><p>I see a lot of other people who apparently also find iron skillets as mystifying as I did. What&#39;s upsetting to me about this phenomenon is that it represents a common feedback loop between technology, ignorance, and consumerism. Non-stick cookware obviates the need to understand any of the facts I&#39;ve mentioned here. But it does wear down, whereas an iron skillet will <i>never</i> become any worse for wear. Not having any iron around, we lose this basic competence and come to depend on disposable alternatives to a tool that ought to be indestructible and timeless.</p></div></div></div></main><div class="post-footer container"><p>I write about Haskell and related topics; you can find my works online on <a href="http://typeclasses.com">Type Classes</a> and in print from <a href="http://joyofhaskell.com"><span style="text-decoration: italic;">The Joy of Haskell</span></a>.</p></div></body></html>
