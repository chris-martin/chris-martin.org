I&#39;d like not to
write for that website anymore. It&#39;s nothing against Twitter specifically. I
want to be more in control of my own writing. It&#39;s the same reason I stopped
writing for Stack Overflow.</p><p>I got into a very strong Twitter habit because being able to publish a thread
incrementally, as I think of things, helps me get writing out there instead of
just letting things stew under excessive editing. I do a thread throughout the
day, thinking of it in the background, and it doesn&#39;t have to take up a
concerted block of time that I would usually dedicate to a blog post. This is
why I&#39;ve got sixty thousand tweets on main, whereas I&#39;ve not blogged in a year.</p><p>I&#39;ve been sacrificing more than I&#39;d like for the sake of easily developing the
habit I wanted, and I don&#39;t think it has to be this way. There shouldn&#39;t be any
reason I can&#39;t write that way without a website to coerce me into it.</p><p>I&#39;ve requested my Twitter archive, and I&#39;ve been thinking about gradually
pulling out anything interesting I&#39;ve written into blog posts, perhaps backdated
in some way. Not everything I recover is necessarily meant to go on the blog,
but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got for now. What I really want is to get it all into a
format I have some control over. What happens next, I have ideas.</p></div></div></div></main><div class="post-footer container"><p>I write about Haskell and related topics; you can find my works online on <a href="http://typeclasses.com">Type Classes</a> and in print from <a href="http://joyofhaskell.com"><span style="text-decoration: italic;">The Joy of Haskell</span></a>.</p></div></body></html>
