Sometimes I come to regret the loss of a thing, but more often not. When I bought my car in 2011, it came with a mounting bracket for a front license plate. The state of Georgia issues only a rear plate, and so this plastic rectangle I&#39;d never use sat worthless in a closet until it became casualty to a fit of minimalism some years later.</p><p>In 2015 I mostly inhabited tiny offices and apartments of California. I felt the weight of every pound in my suitcase and every object in the coworking space. I confess, the phrase &quot;digital nomad&quot; was in my head as I spent my Bitcoin on the lightest laptop Dell had to offer. I decided to swear off all paper — I am a <i>computer programmer</i>, damn it. I can scan, shred, and file into the cloud any sheet of nonsense you want to give me. Books, undigitized, are far too difficult to move; the imposition would hamper my readiness to make a quick escape from Unaffordable Valley.</p><p>For most of 2016 I read research papers in Kentucky cafes. I printed them because I found it difficult to focus and take notes on the tiny laptop. I used FedEx print kiosks; our office had no printer. I was one of the old men, nearly thirty, and my younger colleagues seemed mildly amused by my little stack of coffee-stained paper.</p><p>Julie&#39;s collection of books serves her love of reading, her distaste for disembodied confinement to a computer, and above all the encouragement of her children&#39;s love of reading. One problem with using screens is that people can&#39;t tell what you&#39;re doing. Julie is not only an avid reader, but <i>visibly</i> so — the children see her read, they see the books on her desk, and they do the same. And they read books because books are there. <i>Physically</i> there. When they look around for something to do, what they see is books.</p><p>In 2019, I bought a replacement for the discarded bracket to mount my new Montana-issued tags. I don&#39;t feel too bad about the waste; one cannot predict every future need. The children are now reading Calvin and Hobbes collections that I acquired when I was ten and could never bring myself to get rid of. But I guess that&#39;s a different kind of thing. The comics aren&#39;t something I&#39;ve kept in case I might need them someday; they&#39;re something I choose to keep around because I want their continuing influence — I want the physical imposition on our space. I never predicted that they would end up presenting themselves to the children, but that is what has happened and I am grateful for it.</p><p>As an author, I ought to be happy that we can sell e-books with zero printing and shipping overhead. But in truth, the print sales make me a lot happier. We make these products because we want them to affect people. We want them to have a life that extends beyond a single reader. We want to give our ideas inertia, that stubborn quality unique to matter that makes it difficult to remove.</p></div></div></div></main><div class="post-footer container"><p>I write about Haskell and related topics; you can find my works online on <a href="http://typeclasses.com">Type Classes</a> and in print from <a href="http://joyofhaskell.com"><span style="text-decoration: italic;">The Joy of Haskell</span></a>.</p></div></body></html>
