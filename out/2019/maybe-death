Computerland operates under a strict rule; if you so much as utter a single sentence that is nonsensical or ambiguous, you will be killed.</p><p>For example, these expressions will result in your prompt termination:</p><ul><li>&quot;colorless green ideas&quot;</li><li>&quot;the fifth letter in the word &#39;soup&#39;&quot;</li></ul><p>If we come across a friend holding a box, we might ask:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;What color is the object in the box?&quot;</p></li></ul><p>If the box contains one object, our friend may tell us its color. If the box is empty, however, or if it contains more than one object, then it&#39;s all over. We should therefore be sure to ask a preliminary question first to ascertain whether the second question is permitted:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;How many objects are in the box?&quot;</p></li></ul><p>If the answer is &quot;one,&quot; then we know that &quot;the object in the box&quot; is well-defined, and we may ask our friend about its color.</p><p>This still seems risky. With my life at stake, I would prefer to not to be in the habit of using the expression &quot;the object in the box&quot; under any circumstance; it would be too easy to be careless and slip up if I didn&#39;t correctly keep track of what questions I had already asked. I&#39;d rather combine the two questions into one:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Does the box contain exactly one object <i>x</i>, and if so then what is the color of <i>x</i>?&quot;</p></li></ul><p>To which we may receive a reply such as:</p><ul><li>&quot;No&quot;</li><li>&quot;Yes, blue&quot;</li></ul></div></div></div></main><div class="post-footer container"><p>I write about Haskell and related topics; you can find my works online on <a href="http://typeclasses.com">Type Classes</a> and in print from <a href="http://joyofhaskell.com"><span style="text-decoration: italic;">The Joy of Haskell</span></a>.</p></div></body></html>
