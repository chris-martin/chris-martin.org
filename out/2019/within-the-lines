The air, memories of pebbles, music and colors in the sand danced before Fisher&#39;s eyes and heart in a pattern which comforted him. He walked and thought within the lines of a big Navajo rug.

Patterns of his own life and those of others shimmered about him, separate for a time.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></main><div class="post-footer container"><p>I write about Haskell and related topics; you can find my works online on <a href="http://typeclasses.com">Type Classes</a> and in print from <a href="http://joyofhaskell.com"><span style="text-decoration: italic;">The Joy of Haskell</span></a>.</p></div></body></html>
