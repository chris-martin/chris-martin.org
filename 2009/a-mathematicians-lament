<a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_03_08.html">&quot;A Mathematician’s Lament&quot;</a>
by Paul Lockhart.</p><p>The big question everyone had in middle-to-high school mathematics classes was
&quot;When am I ever going to use this?&quot; Those few who had interest in the subject
tried to justify the existence of math class. But we were completely wrong.
You asked the right quesion, and the answer was: Never. Your time is being
wasted, and you are being frustrated needlessly, because they are teaching all
the wrong things.</p><p>I do recommend everyone read this, although it is a bit long. Below are my
favorite excerpts.</p><hr><blockquote><p>By removing the creative process and leaving only the results of that
process, you virtually guarantee that no one will have any real engagement
with the subject. It is like <i>saying</i> that Michelangelo created a beautiful
sculpture, without letting me <i>see</i> it. How am I supposed to be inspired by
that? (And of course it’s actually much worse than this— at least it’s
understood that there is an art of sculpture that I am being prevented from
appreciating).</p><p>By concentrating on <i>what</i>, and leaving out <i>why</i>, mathematics is reduced to
an empty shell. The art is not in the &quot;truth&quot; but in the explanation, the
argument. It is the argument itself which gives the truth its context, and
determines what is really being said and meant. Mathematics is <i>the art of
explanation</i>. If you deny students the opportunity to engage in this
activity— to pose their own problems, make their own conjectures and
discoveries, to be wrong, to be creatively frustrated, to have an
inspiration, and to cobble together their own explanations and proofs— you
deny them mathematics itself. So no, I’m not complaining about the presence
of facts and formulas in our mathematics classes, I’m complaining about the
lack of <i>mathematics</i> in our mathematics classes.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The saddest part of all this &quot;reform&quot; are the attempts to &quot;make math
interesting&quot; and &quot;relevant to kids’ lives.&quot; You don’t need to <i>make</i> math
interesting— it’s already more interesting than we can handle! And the glory
of it is its complete <i>irrelevance</i> to our lives. That’s why it’s so fun!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In place of a natural problem context in which students can make decisions
about what they want their words to mean, and what notions they wish to
codify, they are instead subjected to an endless sequence of unmotivated and
a priori &quot;definitions.&quot; The curriculum is obsessed with jargon and
nomenclature, seemingly for no other purpose than to provide teachers with
something to test the students on. No mathematician in the world would bother
making these senseless distinctions: 2 1/2 is a &quot;mixed number,&quot; while 5/2 is
an &quot;improper fraction. &quot; They’re <i>equal</i> for crying out loud. They are the
same exact numbers, and have the same exact properties. Who uses such words
outside of fourth grade?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What is happening is the systematic undermining of the student’s intuition. A
proof, that is, a mathematical argument, is a work of fiction, a poem. Its
goal is to <i>satisfy</i>. A beautiful proof should explain, and it should explain
clearly, deeply, and elegantly. A well-written, well-crafted argument should
feel like a splash of cool water, and be a beacon of light— it should refresh
the spirit and illuminate the mind. And it should be <i>charming</i>.</p><p>There is nothing charming about what passes for proof in geometry class.
Students are presented a rigid and dogmatic format in which their so-called
&quot;proofs&quot; are to be conducted— a format as unnecessary and inappropriate as
insisting that children who wish to plant a garden refer to their flowers by
genus and species.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></main></body></html>
