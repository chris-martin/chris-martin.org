I like what I wrote for my 2340 survey comment. So I'm sharing it.

I would like to write an essay on why Cincom Visualworks should not be used
for this course, but I'm sure everyone else is also saying this, so I'll keep
it brief.

Smalltalk's "everything is an object" idea sounds like it makes the perfect
2340 language in theory, but it's really not that much different from any
other OO language. The only difference is that it has no literals - which only
affects a handful of data types. So, the statement that Smalltalk is "more"
object-oriented than, say, Java, is not significantly true.

I cannot imagine why a type-safe language was not chosen for this course. It
was interesting every time a code example in the lecture had to be given in
Java, because it would not make sense in Smalltalk. "Program to interfaces"
is great advice, but it's not something we can see in our projects because the
language doesn't have interfaces!

The IDE is what made me dislike this project the most. It forces code to be
spread out over countless windows, panels, and tabs, making it very difficult
to find code that other group members have written. Version control, which
would be incredibly easy with SVN and flat text files, is a chore under
Visualworks Store. I think a lot more people would give Smalltalk a chance if
it could be edited in a decent program. We all have our favorite environments
and text editors, and Visualworks replaces all of that with aliased fonts, no
syntax coloring, few key shortcuts, and plenty more fodder for a negative
design review. Cincom has reinvented the wheel, and it is shaped like a
square.

Course reviews are fun.
