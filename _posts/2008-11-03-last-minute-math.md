As I was leaving for AVS this morning, I happened upon a take-home test for
Graph Theory which I should have done this weekend, and was now due in roughly
2 hours. I froze, panicked for about 5 seconds, then sat down to do some math.
About an hour later, I'm done. And my proof is decently eloquent. Victory.

I think people complain too much about classes being hard.
