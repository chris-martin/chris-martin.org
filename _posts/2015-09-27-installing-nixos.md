I just installed NixOS on my laptop. This is a summary of my experience.

I hope you find it useful if you're new to NixOS or setting up full disk
encryption. Feel free to tweet questions at me and I'll help if I can,
though you'll find more knowledgable folks in the `#nixos` channel on
Freenode.

I keep my NixOS configuration in [a git repository][git]. I recommend
learning from other people's configuration files and sharing your own.

Much of this follows Bluish Coder's
[Installing NixOS on a ThinkPad W540 with encrypted root][bluish]
and [Encrypted Root on NixOS][wiki-encrypted-root] on the NixOS wiki.

## My requirements, constraints, and choices

* The hardware: Samsung Series 9 NP900X4C-A06US
* Replacing the entire disk's content, preserving nothing.
* Must have encrypted root and swap.
* Laptop has no CD drive, so must boot from USB.
* Laptop has no ethernet port, so must use wifi (more specifically, WPA)
  during installation.
* UEFI boot.

## Preview

Here's what it's going to look like once NixOS is installed.

### The boot loader

Here's what my boot loader looks like after I've been using this system
for a couple weeks and have rebuilt the configuration 114 times.

</div>

### Unlocking the encrypted disk

In the first stage of the boot process, NixOS stops to let you enter
the passphrase before proceeding.

## Creating NixOS USB installer

Download NixOS [15.09.336.83cc494][download] x86_64 minimal install ISO.

*(I first tried the latest stable release, 14.12, and had an error
installing Grub. I switched to this particular build of NixOS 15.09
on [Domen Ko≈æar's recommendation][tweet].)*

Load it onto a flash drive using unetbootin.

*(I don't know if there's a better way to do this. Creating USB install
media is still a huge mystery to me; I don't get why it's so complicated
or why there's seemingly no authoritative method.)*

The volume label must be `NIXOS_ISO`:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo mlabel -i <device> -s ::"NIXOS_ISO  "
{% endhighlight %}

Note the spaces that pad the label name to
[exactly 11 characters][label-11-chars].

Boot the NixOS live "CD". It contains the utilities that you'll need to
set up the disk, and of course the NixOS installer.

## Disk layout

Here's a somewhat high-level depiction of the disk we're about to set up.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 3em;">
  <img src="/assets/posts/2015-09-27-installing-nixos/disk.png"
       style="max-width: 100%;"/>
</div>

There are three partitions:

* `/dev/sda1` is the BIOS boot partition. Don't ask me exactly what this
  is for, all I know is it has to be there.
* `/dev/sda2` will be mounted at `/boot`. This is unencrypted,
  because the boot process will need it before we unlock the encrypted
  volume.
* `/dev/sda3` is the encrypted partition.

The encrypted partition contains an LVM volume group called `vg`, which
contains two logical volumes:

* `/dev/vg/swap` will be used as swap space.
* `/dev/vg/root` will be mounted at the root of the filesystem, `/`.

### Create partitions

Run `fdisk -l` to show disks. Mine is `/dev/sda`.

Use `gdisk` to create the partitions.

{% highlight bash %}
gdisk /dev/sda
{% endhighlight %}

I won't teach you how to use `gdisk` here, but create a partition table
that looks like this:

{% highlight text %}
Number  Size        Code  Name
  1     1000.0 KiB  EF02  BIOS boot partition
  2     500.0 MiB   EF00  EFI System Partition
  3     <the rest>  8E00  Linux LVM
{% endhighlight %}

### Set up LUKS

Initialize the encrypted partition. This will prompt you to create a
passphrase (which can be changed later, so don't fret if you haven't
generated a good one yet).

{% highlight bash %}
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda3
{% endhighlight %}

Then open it:

{% highlight bash %}
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 enc-pv
{% endhighlight %}

I have no idea what `enc-pv` means here, I'm just following instructions.

### Create LVM group and volumes

This allocates 10G for swap, and the rest for the root volume. 

{% highlight bash %}
pvcreate /dev/mapper/enc-pv
vgcreate vg /dev/mapper/enc-pv
lvcreate -n swap vg -L 10G
lvcreate -n root vg -l 100%FREE
{% endhighlight %}

### Format partitions

{% highlight bash %}
mkfs.vfat -n BOOT /dev/sda2
mkfs.ext4 -L root /dev/vg/root
mkswap -L swap /dev/vg/swap
{% endhighlight %}

## Installation

### Mount

Now mount all the disks and volumes you just created. But not where we
said we were going to mount them.

The NixOS installer treats `/mnt` as the filesystem root for the installation.
So instead of mounting to `/` and `/boot` as we discussed above, for now
we're going to mount them to `/mnt` and `/mnt/boot` instead:

{% highlight bash %}
mount /dev/vg/root /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot
{% endhighlight %}

Also activate the swap space:

{% highlight bash %}
swapon /dev/vg/swap
{% endhighlight %}

### Configuration

Run this to generate config files:

{% highlight bash %}
nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
{% endhighlight %}

This creates two files in `/mnt/etc/nixos`:

* `configuration.nix`, a default config file.
  (You'll be making changes to this a lot).
* `hardware-configuration.nix`, the results of a hardware scan.
  (You don't edit this.)

Add this stuff to the `configuration.nix`:

{% highlight text %}
boot.initrd.luks.devices = [
  {
    name = "root";
    device = "/dev/sda3";
    preLVM = true;
  }
];

boot.loader.grub.device = "/dev/sda";

networking.wireless.enable = true;
{% endhighlight text %}

Hopefully its meaning is mostly self-explanatory, as NixOS configuration
tends to be.

### Wifi

Disable the `wpa_supplicant` service that's running, and run it yourself
specifying the WPA credentials.

{% highlight bash %}
systemctl stop wpa_supplicant.service
wpa_supplicant -B -i interface -c <(wpa_passphrase 'SSID' 'key')
{% endhighlight %}

I'm not sure why, exactly, but that's what
[the wiki][wpa_supplicant] says to do.

### If you reboot during this process

After you've created the partitions and LVM volumes, here's a recap of
everything you need to set up when you boot from the install media again.

{% highlight bash %}
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 enc-pv
lvchange -a y /dev/vg/swap
lvchange -a y /dev/vg/root
mount /dev/vg/root /mnt
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot
swapon /dev/vg/swap
systemctl stop wpa_supplicant.service
wpa_supplicant -B -i interface -c <(wpa_passphrase 'SSID' 'key')
{% endhighlight %}

### Install

{% highlight bash %}
nixos-install
{% endhighlight %}

If that succeeds, then reboot and proceed to boot into your new NixOS install.

{% highlight bash %}
reboot
{% endhighlight %}

## Your first NixOS boot

At this point, there is now a ton of fun stuff to learn that is outside
the scope of this walkthrough. I'm just going to cover the a little bit
of essential configuration to get you started in a graphical environment.

### Connect to wifi again

We'll get a network manager set up soon, but for now run these commands
again to get back on wifi.

{% highlight bash %}
systemctl stop wpa_supplicant.service
wpa_supplicant -B -i interface -c <(wpa_passphrase 'SSID' 'key')
{% endhighlight %}

### Add the 15.09 package channel

In a root shell:

{% highlight bash %}
nix-channel --add http://nixos.org/channels/nixos-15.09
nix-channel --update
{% endhighlight %}

### Editing the config file 

You'll be editing `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` a lot.

When you do, run `nixos-rebuild switch` to apply the changes.

### Create a user

Here's my initial user config:

{% highlight text %}
users.extraUsers.chris = {
  name = "chris";
  group = "users";
  extraGroups = [
    "wheel" "disk" "audio" "video"
    "networkmanager" "systemd-journal"
  ];
  createHome = true;
  uid = 1000;
  home = "/home/chris";
  shell = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash";
};
{% endhighlight  %}

Its password obviously doesn't go in the config file, so
you have to run this command to set it:

{% highlight bash %}
passwd chris
{% endhighlight %}

### Enable graphical environment

Add this config to enable KDE and the touchpad:

{% highlight text %}
services.xserver = {
  enable = true;
  desktopManager.kde4.enable = true;
  synaptics.enable = true;
};
{% endhighlight %}

*(I haven't used KDE in a long time, but I decided on a whim to try it
again&mdash;and I am delightfully surprised by how it has improved.)*

### Enable network management

Now you'll want to turn on the network manager which can manage your
WPA keys so you don't have to keep manually messing with `wpa_supplicant`.

Replace

{% highlight text %}
networking.wireless.enable = true;
{% endhighlight %}

with

{% highlight text %}
networking.networkmanager.enable = true;
{% endhighlight %}

Also add `kde4.networkmanagement` to the package list to get a GUI for it.

## Reference documentation

If you add this config:

{% highlight text %}
services.nixosManual.showManual = true;
{% endhighlight %}

Then ctrl+alt+F8 gives you the manual in a terminal, which may be nice
to keep around in case of emergency.

`nixos-help` opens the manual in a browser window.

`nixos-option` is a good reference for the configuration options.

To search for packages, use `nix-env -qaP | grep ...`.
The left column shows attribute paths (which is what you need for
`systemPackages` in the config), and the right column shows package names.
