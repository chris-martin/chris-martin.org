Slashdot recently featured ["A Mathematician's Lament"][lament] by Paul
Lockhart.

The big question everyone had in middle-to-high school mathematics classes was
"When am I ever going to use this?" Those few who had interest in the subject
tried to justify the existence of math class. But we were completely wrong.
You asked the right quesion, and the answer was: Never. Your time is being
wasted, and you are being frustrated needlessly, because they are teaching all
the wrong things.

I do recommend everyone read this, although it is a bit long. Below are my
favorite excerpts.
