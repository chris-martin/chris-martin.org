*All programs must have side effects to be useful* &mdash; can we please stop
repeating this awful lie? Side effects are great, but they must not be
observable from within the program. It is same with pencil-and-paper: writing
out a calculation shortens the pencil lead, but the calculation isn't affected
by that. If you believe programs can be proofs, you cannot think they must have
side effects to be useful.

if you think programs can be proofs you can&#39;t think they must have
